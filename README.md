# ASCII-ART-MAKER
I've made this for fun(not really, I've just broken up with my girldriend, so the first thing i made in ascii was her photo)


Warning! This program can read only 24bit format of *.bmp files. Maybe I will add support of others formats soon.

Notepad windows 11 22h2 is the best for this ascii art maker. I can't promise that it will look ok in another text editors and in oldest windows version.

Good bye, world!
